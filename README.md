Got it â€”  
you want a **concise, simple, clean, human-like** README **exactly like** the format you just shared.  
I'll update it properly to also **include Docker**, **seeding**, **Swagger**, etc. â€” following *your exact vibe*.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jainnaman-jain/project_sparklehood
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd project_sparklehood
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your MongoDB connection string:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your-mongodb-connection-string
   ```

5. **Seed the database (optional for local setup):**

   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Access the API documentation:**

   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api-docs
   ```

---

## Docker Setup

1. **Build and run the project with Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **What this does:**
   - Starts the Node.js app
   - Connects to MongoDB
   - Seeds the database automatically
   - Exposes the app at `http://localhost:8000`

---

## Seeding Data

- A seed script `seed.js` is included.
- It adds sample incidents such as:
  - AI chatbot spreading misinformation
  - Bias in AI recruitment system
  - AI model causing privacy leak
- When using Docker, the data is automatically seeded when containers start.
